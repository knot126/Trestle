# Trestle Engine

**Trestle Engine** is a game and simulation engine. It <s>is</s> *will* be designed to support more per-game physics simulations, procedurally generated content and tighter integration between heterogeneous compute and scripting.

***Important**: Trestle is currently undergoing a transition which will take a very different approach compared to what it was and what most current game engines are. I don't really want to begin to write a new engine yet, but I am considering starting a new engine project.*

## Building
