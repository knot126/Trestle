# Quick Run Engine To-Do

This doesn't list the obvious things like physics, graphics, etc. More about background stuff that I will actually not notice until it's a bit late..

 * Serialisation to and from JSON
 * Compression algoritm for storing and loading compressed files
   * Zlib or Zstd?
   * ZIP folder mounting and unmounting
 * Update the build system to something better
 * Windows port
 * Android port (?)
